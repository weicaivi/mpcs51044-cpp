The modifications are improvements over the original code:

1. Memory Safety:
- Original: Used raw pointers, requiring manual memory management which is error-prone and could lead to memory leaks
- Modified: Uses `unique_ptr` which provides automatic cleanup and makes ownership semantics explicit

2. Type Flexibility:
- Original: Hard-coded to work only with `int`
- Modified: Uses templates, allowing the tree to work with any comparable type

3. Rule of Five Implementation:
- Original: Missing copy constructor and assignment operator, violating Rule of Three
- Modified: implements all five special member functions, including move semantics
- This prevents undefined behavior when copying trees and allows efficient moving of trees

4. Enhanced Interface:
- Added `contains()` method which is safer than exposing raw node pointers
- Added `empty()` and `clear()` for better state management
- Returns `const T*` from search rather than exposing internal node structure

5. Better Encapsulation:
- Node struct is now private, preventing external code from manipulating the tree's internal structure
- Internal helper functions are more clearly separated from the public interface
