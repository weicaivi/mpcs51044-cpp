Modifications: 

- Implementation of the Rule of Five (copy/move constructors and assignments)
    -- Use of nullptr instead of NULL
    -- Consistent const correctness
    -- noexcept specifications where appropriate
    -- Added empty() method for state checking
    -- Added clear() for explicit cleanup
    -- Added at() method that throws on missing keys
    -- Changed search() to return a boolean for cleaner public interface


The modifications are an improvements over the original implementation

Template Support: Making the class templated with template<typename T> greatly increases its flexibility, allowing it to store any comparable type rather than just integers. This makes the class much more reusable.

Memory Safety: Using std::unique_ptr instead of raw pointers eliminates potential memory leaks and makes ownership semantics clear. The original implementation required manual memory management which is error-prone.

Exception Safety: The modified version is exception-saf (RAII) through unique_ptr and proper copy operations. The std::make_unique usage also provides strong exception guarantees during node creation.
Modern C++ Features:

Better Encapsulation: 1) Node struct is properly hidden in private section 2) Internal helper functions are clearly separated from public interface 3) Header guards prevent multiple inclusion
