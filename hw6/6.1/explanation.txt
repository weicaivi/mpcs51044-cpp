How do their performance compare?
The three implementations show dramatically different scaling behaviors. The Single Counter performs best with one thread (39,318 ops/ms) but degrades severely as threads increase, dropping to just 3,360 ops/ms with 16 threads due to lock contention. The Bucketed Counter scales much better, reaching 118,081 ops/ms with 16 threads by distributing the load across multiple counters to reduce contention. The Padded Counter performs similarly to the Bucketed Counter at low thread counts but shows superior scaling at higher thread counts, achieving 327,421 ops/ms with 16 threads, nearly 3x better than the Bucketed Counter and almost 100x better than the Single Counter.

What do you conclude?
The results demonstrate that naive synchronization using a single mutex (DistributedCounter1) doesn't scale in highly concurrent scenarios. Distributing the contention across multiple buckets (DistributedCounter2) significantly improves performance by reducing lock conflicts. However, the most dramatic improvement comes from combining distributed counters with cache-conscious design through padding (DistributedCounter3), which prevents false sharing and allows for much better scaling at higher thread counts. This shows that both logical contention and hardware-level cache effects must be considered when designing concurrent data structures.

Do you think the results would be the same on other computers? Why or why not?
No, the results would vary significantly across different computers due to several hardware-specific factors. CPU architecture differences like cache line sizes, number of physical cores, and memory hierarchy would affect the relative performance of these implementations. The effectiveness of the 256-byte padding in DistributedCounter3 depends on the specific CPU's cache line size, while the optimal number of buckets (128) might need adjustment for different systems. Additionally, system-specific factors like memory speed, CPU frequency, and thermal conditions would influence the absolute performance numbers, though the general trends of scaling would likely remain similar.
