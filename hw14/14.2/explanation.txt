it's not reasonable to expect std::sort to work on std::list.

std::sort requires random access iterators, which allow constant-time access to any element (like v[i]). This is because sorting algorithms like quicksort and heapsort need to jump around in the container efficiently.

std::list provides only bidirectional iterators, which can move forward and backward one step at a time, but can't perform random access.

Trying to implement random access on a linked list would be extremely inefficient, requiring O(n) traversal for each access.

The standard library's design intentionally guides users toward efficient solutions for their specific data structures. Trying to make std::sort work on a list would be defeating the fundamental data structure characteristics.

If someone wants to sort a std::list, they can use std::list::sort(), or convert to a random access container.
