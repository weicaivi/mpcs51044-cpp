I prefer the jthread version better.

jthread automatically joins in its destructor so forgetting
to call .join() won't lead to program termination. 

If an exception occurs between thread creation and the join calls,
jthread still ensures proper cleanup. With std::thread, we'd need to
write extra try-catch blocks to handle this safely.
