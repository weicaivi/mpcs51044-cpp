I prefer `const int` over `int const`.

In many programming languages, we read modifiers from left to right.
`const int` follows this natural reading pattern. With `int const`, we
have to mentally reorder the modifiers.

`const int` is also more consistent with function declarations, where
const must go to the left of what it modifies.
