Member functions are generally better for operator+=. This is because They have 
direct access to the class's private members, making implementation cleaner and 
more efficient by avoiding getter/setter calls. They better reflect that += 
modifies the left operand in-place, making the relationship between the operation
and the modified object clearer

The exception is when the left operand cannot be modified (e.g., adding to a
primitive type), making a global function is necessary.
